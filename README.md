# GammaOS Next

GammaOS Next is a highly customized Android firmware based on Android 13 / LineageOS 20. It delivers a streamlined, performance-optimized experience with extensive tweaks and enhancements to improve responsiveness, battery life, and user control.

## Features

### Core System
- **Android 13 / LineageOS 20 Base**: A clean, debloated build for snappy performance and minimal bloat.  
- **Google Services & Lite Option**: Full Google Play Store support in standard builds, or choose “Lite” to forgo Google apps and maximize performance.  
- **Aurora Store**: Seamlessly sideload apps without needing a Google account.

### User Interface & Navigation
- **Daijisho Launcher**: Pre-configured for RetroArch (GB, GBC, GBA, NES, SNES, Genesis, PSX). (BIOS files must be supplied by the user.)  
- **App Drawer in Navigation Bar**: Instantly access any installed app from the nav bar—no more returning to home to switch apps.  
- **Screen Rotation Controls**: Enforce landscape mode when rotation is disabled, ensuring your games and apps stay in the correct orientation.

### Input & Controls
- **Universal Button Remapping**: Remap any physical button to any other key or button input, giving you total flexibility over your gamepad layout.  
- **Analog Stick Calibration**: Fine-tune stick behavior by adjusting range and deadzone settings for tighter, more precise controls.  
- **L2/R2 Fixes**: Corrected L2 and R2 button behavior to ensure compatibility in games and apps.  
- **Layout Persistence**: Once you choose a button layout (XBOX, NS, etc.), it remains across reboots—no reconfiguration required.

### Display & Lighting
- **DC Dimming Emulation**: Reduce PWM flicker on devices that exhibit it, making long play sessions easier on the eyes.  
- **GammaRGB LED Sync**: For supported devices, mirror on-screen colors to RGB LEDs on the analog sticks and synchronize LED brightness with screen brightness.  
- **60 Hz Refresh Rate & Oversharpening Fixes**: Smooth display performance with corrected refresh and oversharpening issues.

### Performance & Power
- **Performance Governors**: CPU, GPU, and memory tuned to performance profiles for extra speed when you need it.  
- **Quick Settings Tiles**: One-tap toggles for performance modes, analog sensitivity adjustments, ABXY remapping, axis inversion, and D-pad/analog swaps—and much more
- **Deep Sleep Mode**: Force-freeze background apps via cgroup modifications to prevent emulators or other apps from running unnecessarily (use with caution—some apps may break).

### Root & Modding
- **Magisk Root**: Pre-installed root access with Magisk, ready for modules, custom ROM tweaks, or system modifications.  

### Storage & Security
- **Relaxed Scoped Storage**: Loosened security requirements so apps can freely access files without being blocked, making file management and emulator setups simpler.

Enjoy the ultimate combination of power, customization, and ease-of-use with GammaOS Next! 

### Performance Modes

- **Max Performance**: All frequencies at maximum. Highest performance, highest battery drain.
- **Normal Performance**: Dynamic scaling based on load.
- **Power Save**: Frequencies lowered to minimum for maximum battery life (ideal for light emulation, e.g., GBA).
